    <h2 class="subheading center">By Tristan Scott</h2>

        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>In this CSS sampler project, I aimed to explore the concept of screen time, examining the idea of unplugging
            from media and reconnecting with healthy values. Initially, I intended to research the impacts of physical
            and mental health and incorporate supportive imagery. However, I found myself primarily taking an artistic
            and poetic approach, learning how to use new CSS techniques while experimenting with these themes and
            concepts on my website.
        </p>
        <p>
            My initial step involved visually researching textile samplers. I found inspiration in those that
            effectively utilized the grid, appreciating the appeal of symmetrically organizing asymmetric elements. The
            emerging patterns in these samplers were visually captivating. Textile samplers also often feature
            references and phrases related to the home or other beliefs. I sought to parallel most of these elements
            within my website, experimenting with different levels of humor and symbolism.
        </p>
        <p>
            Contemplating the boundary between online digital spaces and real-world natural spaces, I pondered how to
            visually represent these contrasts within my website. Initially, I considered incorporating imagery and
            iconography associated with virtual spaces, alongside depictions of nature or images conveying the loss of
            signal or connection.
        </p>
        <p>
            Further into the creative process, the themes of screen time and pixels began to dominate. This led me to
            create images in Photoshop, juxtaposing outdoor scenes and beautiful landscapes within old TV screens. These
            pieces symbolize how screens merely imitate the real world, striving to capture attention and maintain
            viewership.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the bottom of the composition lies the representation of "unplugging" from screens and media, showcasing
            more natural colors and animations, along with text and imagery that evokes peace, nature, and health. My
            aim was to visually represent or recreate the feeling the effect that unplugging from media can have on ones
            mental health. Taking breaks offers an opportunity to disconnect from the constant barrage of information
            and stimuli, allowing the mind to rest and recharge.</p>

        <p>Throughout the project, I experimented with various CSS techniques to create a visually engaging and

            <p> Here is a list of some helpful CSS guides that I used both directly and for inspiration as I was
                exploring
                the use of different techniques. Some of these were not used, but I will include them as they could be
                beneficial techniques to learn for future projects. Resources such as <a
